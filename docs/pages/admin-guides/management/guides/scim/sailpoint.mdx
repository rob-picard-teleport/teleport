description: How to Configure SCIM Connector in SailPoint to manage Access List membership
---


Sailpoint Provide the SCIM Identity Management Connector that allows to manage Teleport Access List membership
through SailPoint IdentityNow or SailPoint IdentityIQ.

## Prerequisites
- Teleport SCIM plugin setup: [SCIM Plugin Installation](./scim.mdx)

## Step 1/2: Configure a SCIM 2.0 Teleport connector in SailPoint

To integrate Teleport with SailPoint using SCIM, you need to configure a SCIM connector in SailPoint IdentityNow or SailPoint IdentityIQ.
The exact configuration steps may vary slightly depending on your version of SailPoint, but the general process is as follows:

### Configure SCIM in SailPoint

Create a new SCIM connector in SailPoint at: Applications > Application Definition > Add New Application.
Select **SCIM 2.0** as the application type and provide the required configuration details:

Set the **Base URL** and provided by Teleport under **Configuration -> Settings**.
Set the Authentication Type to OAuth 2.0 with the Grant Type set to **Client Credentials**.
Copy Client ID and Client Secret from the saved Teleport SCIM configuration settings.
Click **Test Connection** to verify that the connection is successful:

### Configure SCIM schema discovery

Under  **Configuration -> Schema**, click **Discover Schema Attributes** on both the **Accounts** and **Groups** tabs to retrieve the schema attributes:

Go to the **Provisioning Policy** section, and create a **Create Policy** that maps the `userName` SCIM attribute to the userâ€™s email address:

Save all changes.

#### Configure SCIM group aggregation in SailPoint


SailPoint group aggregation enables the retrieval of SCIM-type Access Lists into SailPoint as Application Group Entitlements.
This allows you import Teleport Access List into SailPoint and membership directly through SailPoint.

Navigate to **Setup > Tasks -> New Task -> Group Aggregation**.
![Select Aggregation](../../../../../img/SailPoint/SailPoint-6.png)
Select the **Teleport SCIM Connector**, then click **Save and Execute** to run the aggregation task.
![Configure Aggregation](../../../../../img/SailPoint/SailPoint-7.png)
If the aggregation completes successfully,
you should see the imported Access Lists `type: "scim"` from Teleport in SailPoint under: **Applications > Entitlement Catalog**

## Step 2/2: Submit Access Requests to SailPoint Group Entitlement (Optional)

Go to Manage > Manage User Access > Manage User Access.
Submit an Access Request for a mapped Access List (as represented by a group
entitlement in SailPoint).

Once the request is approved, the user will be added to the appropriate Access List in Teleport.
